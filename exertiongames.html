                                With our sedentary lifestyles we tend to move less than the suggested amount of 10000 steps per day. This is doubly true
                                in universities and schools, where the majority of time is spend in a seated position. This
                                concept helps people move more by nudging them to use a flight of stairs instead of the elevators.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                The concept is as follows. It is an opt-in program students and employees can use to earn movement points for walking up
                                or down flight of stairs. These points can only be gained via stair usage, and as such dissuades
                                elevator usage. But this alone would not be enough to persuade most people. As such people
                                can use these points to redeem certain discounts on student or otherwise relevant products.
                                This overview should be easily accessible to the user.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                It works as follows, students or employees who wish to partake will intuitively grab onto the railing as they walk up a flight
                                of stairs. These railing scan the hand and fingerprints to match it to the signature placed
                                in the central database, as such the opt-in, since some people might find this to intrusive.
                                Therefore a less intrusive, but more clunky method such as the student cards could be used.
                                As they walk up the stairs it measures them again at the exit of the stairs at the railing.
                                The system internally knows all stairs and the amount of steps it is and matches the reward
                                accordingly. This reward is then charged to the user’s account.

                                TARget is a throwing AR exercise designed for physical education. It allows the user to throw at a multitude of different
                                kind of targets projected on different surfaces, primarily walls. At its core it’s a stationary
                                target in the center that light up green when hit, and red when not. Other modes such as
                                varied practice add more elements and difficulty to the exercise. Additionally it can show
                                the player where the ball hit the surface using a hit marker dot.

                                At its core, it is a single player game that simply shows if the target is hit or not. However, people can unofficially compete
                                against each other using the scoring mechanism which tracks how many hits/misses have been
                                made.

                                The interface is a clean design showing minimum information as to let the player focus on the task at hand, namely hitting
                                the target and receiving its feedback.

                                The entire setup is created with a computer, Kinect, beamer and a bunch of cables. The beamer at an elevation at a skewed
                                angle with respect to the wall, in order to give the player freedom of movement. The computer
                                then uses projection mapping software such as MadMapper to present the game at the correct
                                aspect ratio on the wall. A Kinect, which lies flat on the ground under the TARget in a protective
                                casing, measures the area just in front of the wall in order to detect the ball that the
                                player throws, then using a complex calculation it transforms the raw position data from
                                the Kinect to a X and Y coordinate on the screen to see where to player hit the wall. The
                                game then takes over from here and checks what should happen next.

                                This is meant to be a cooperative multiplayer exertion exercise where cyclist can give feedback on each other. They did state

                                this information, which would make it single player.

                                Like stated above, the purpose of the interface is to provide real-time heart rate data to cyclist in a group in an efficient

                                The first version of the prototype worked using Zephyr heart rate monitors which is attached to the chest of the user using
                                a strap. It would measure the heart rate of the cyclist and send this to a nearby computer.
                                After this the computer send the information cleanly to the screen attached to the back of
                                the helmet. They are currently developing a cleaner version of the concept where the screen
                                is integrated with the helmet.

                                Due to my familiarity to the topic is was very hard to have neutral stance towards it, seeing as I am already aware of some
                                if not a majority of the developments in this field. Therefore I also had already seen nearly
                                all the examples given during the lecture.

                                lifestyle. This can be done through various methods such as nudging, rewards or gamification.
