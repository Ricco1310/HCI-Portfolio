                                FeelWellTogether is a revolutionary new tool for inter-personal contacts in busy environments. The FeelWellTogether measures
                                elements such as heart rate and galvanic skin response in people to determine who is at ease
                                in a situation using sensors placed on the persons inner arm, and who is feeling uncomfortable.
                                When a person approaches another person who is also using FeelWellTogether the two will exchange
                                information and let either party know how they are feeling. This allows people to gauge easier
                                if the other party want to talk, and also how relaxed they are with said conversation.
                                <br>Outside of this the FeelWellTogether also allows people who feel insecure opt into a buddy
                                program, were they can give preferences to the FeelWellTogether about who they want to talk
                                to when they are in which mood state. Through this people who might feel uneasy around large
                                groups could try to be paired with someone who is more at ease in these situations. Which
                                could help them.
                                <br>Furthermore the FeelWellTogether allows people who are talking with other people to help
                                them understand how the other person is feeling about said topic and if they accept or reject
                                the topic currently being discussed. This could prove useful during large conversation where
                                not everyone might be on the same wavelength. This tool allows these groups to have common
                                topics to talk about which donâ€™t make some people feel uneasy.
                                <br>Lastly the FeelWellTogether also doubles as a medical control, where if it detects any sudden
                                abnormalities within its user it sends a message to check up on its host. The host then has
                                to confirm that it is still functioning enough to acknowledge its message and cancel the
                                distress call. Firstly the FeelWellTogether would notify a nearby user to check up on its
                                host, otherwise it sends an emergency call to the local authorities. Another feature within
                                this could be an alcohol lock, that locks or unlocks based on the amount of alcohol in the
                                hosts sweat.

                                Unlimited Hand is technology developed by Happy Hacking Life to provide tactile feedback from virtual objects using whilst
                                also allowing direct interaction. This is done via sensors measuring muscle activity in the
                                lower forearm to detect motions. Tactile feedback is achieved via an EMS which discharges
                                controlled electric signals to fake the hands and fingers to think they have real interaction
                                and control.

                                Wearables are an interesting field of work, with many potential applications in the near future. I was most impressed by
                                some of the examples presented during the lecture and those found online with the level of
                                technical fidelity already achieved. As such I am quite looking forward to the future possibilities,
                                especially when paired with AR and VR.
                                <br>I most certainly have high hopes and expectation coming from this field and will be keeping
                                a watchful eye over it for the near future.
